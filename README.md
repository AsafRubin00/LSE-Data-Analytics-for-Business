<h2>Context</h2> 
  <p>
<b>2Market</b> is a (fictional) global supermarket which sells products online and in-store. 2Market wants to understand their customer purchase behaviour across four dimensions: 1) customer demographics, 2) advertising channel effectiveness, 3) which products sell best, and 4) if and how product sales vary by demographic.

Data was analysed in Excel and SQL. 
</p>

<h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
<p>
Raw data provided by 2Market was cleaned in Excel and checked for missing values, duplicates and outliers. Outliers were identified and removed. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was undertaken to compare customer age, marital status and income distribution.

Data was also analysed with SQL in Postgres. A new database was created in Postgres and two tables were imported and analysed as follows:
<ul>
<li>Aggregating data shows to identify the countries with the highest and lowest total sales across product types.</li> 
<li>Combining tables to produce a view of total sales amounts of each product in each country. </li>
<li>The same approach used to provide a view of the most popular product by marital status, and presence of children or teens in each household.</li>
</ul>

SQL (Postgres) was also used to calculate advertising channel effectiveness:
<ul>
<li>Which advertising channel did 2Market spend on most?</li>
<li>Does the trend of advertising expenditure match revenue generated by each country?</li>
<li>Does the trend also reflect advertising channel effectiveness in terms of revenues?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dashboard Design & Development</h2>
<p>
  The <b>2Market Tableau dashboard</b> includes three visualisations, each of which were selected for simplicity and ease of navigation to provide insights into 2Market’s 1) customer demographics, 2) sales trends and 3) advertising platform effectiveness. A basic blue, white and white colour palate was used to ensure readability and captions are included to provide additional relevant information. 

The first stage in the process was the design of a prototype (in an offline sketch) showing the relationships between key variables and ensuring clarity, appropriateness and breadth and depth of information provided. 

In the second stage, worksheets were built in Tableau to examine the relationships between customer demographics and product sales. These were then plotted on a dashboard:

An interactive map showing the locations of 2Market’s operations. Hovering cursor over each country shows further details for that market, including average age, number of customers and median income. Clicking on a country will filter the rest of the dashboard. 
A histogram showing income distribution
A modified box-and-whiskers plot showing average age
A bar chart showing the total sales of each product, which can also be filtered by age group. 

In the third and final stage, data on advertising effectiveness was added to the dashboard. A bar chart showing the number of customer conversions by advertising type is now visible, and can be filtered by variables on the dashboard. 

The dashboard is organized so that viewers can read the charts and data from left to right, starting with an overarching, global view of 2Market’s customer based, with customer-specific details on the right-hand side and finally, sales and advertising details in the bottom half of the dashboard. 
</p>

<h2>Patterns, Trends and Insights</h2>
2Market is interested in three key issues: 1) customer demographics, 2) product popularity, and 3) advertising channel effectiveness. The relationships between these three variables will help inform 2Markets’ decision-making. 
<br><br>
<b>Customer demographics</b>: 2Market operates in 8 countries around the world, with a total 2205 customers. The average 2Market customer is 52 years old and has a median income of $51,287. Spain has the highest customer count with 1089 customers, Montenegro the lowest with 3. Customers in the USA have the highest median income at $55,718, India the lowest at $48,432.39% of customers are married, the largest group by marital status. The majority (57%) have no kids, nor teens at home.  
<br><br>
<b>Products</b>: Liquor is 2Markets’ most lucrative product, with highest sales in Spain. Vegetables have generated the least amount of revenue. 
<br><br>
<b>Advertising</b>: 2Market spent the most on Instagram advertising, followed by Facebook, Twitter, Bulkmail and brochure. Excluding Montenegro, where 100% of advertising is Bulkmail, Instagram is the most effective channel. Each customer ‘converted’ by Instagram spends an average of $102.71.
<br>
Assuming 2Market’s objective is to increase profits, it could consider:
<br><br>
<b>Increasing revenues</b>
<ul>
<li>Focus on high potential geographies where customers have higher median incomes, are married and do not have children or teens at home</li>
<li>Promote sales of liquor and non-vegetables</li>
<li>Continue Instagram, Facebook and Twitter as advertising channels</li>
</ul>
<b>Reducing costs</b>
<ul>
 <li>Exiting markets with small customer bases</li>
 <li>Ceasing sales of chocolates and vegetables</li>
 <li>Cutting brochure and bulkmail</li>
 </ul>
